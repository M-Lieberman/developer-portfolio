									<h3>Career History</h3>
									<p>My career began as a SAS programmer supporting a data entry system for a Clinical Research Organisation, 
										before learning PowerBuilder and moving to the City to build personal insurance applications.
										<br>
										After six years, I switched to Java and joined a newly-created development team to build a new claims handling system. 
										I stayed with the team maintaining and supporting several claims applications until 2018 
										when I moved to a new team as a developer supporting an online broker portal, developed in Mendix. 
										After twenty years at the same company, I left to start a career break at the beginning of 2019.

						<section id="whyreturn">
							<div class="container">
								<h3>Why I Want To Return To Tech</h3>
								<p>I have always enjoyed learning and coding, but I have missed developing applications and working in a team since leaving my last role. 
									During my career break, I have been studying part-time and keeping up-to-date with software development. 
									From September, I will have more time to focus back onto my career.
									<br>
									I feel that my experience and transferable skills, combined with the training and opportunities of the "Your Return To Tech" programme, 
									will ensure I am an asset to my future employers when I return to my career in technology.

											<h4>Food, Glorious Food</h4>
											<p>When I'm not thinking about coding, I'm usually thinking about food. What to eat next, what to cook, what restaurant to visit next. 
												This love for food began after I bought a copy of the Good Food Guide for 50p from my local library and ultimately led to me getting married in a restaurant.  Now every holiday and day trip is centred around what good food there is to eat. </p>

										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Books, Books, Books</h4>
											<p>Reading has been a big part of my life. Fiction-wise, I'm a big fan of early Paul Auster, and my current favourite is Elizabeth Strout. 
												<br/>
												Aside from cookbooks, I have an interest in productivity and psychology, especially in the area of habits and mindset. 
												I found The Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande to be a great book about how to improve processes, especially when working in a high-stakes environment.

											<h4>London</h4>
											<p>I'm a city person and love living in London. Before lockdown, I enjoyed spending time walking around, visiting galleries and museums (and the occasional restaurant). Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney are all amazing cities, but London is the best!</p>
